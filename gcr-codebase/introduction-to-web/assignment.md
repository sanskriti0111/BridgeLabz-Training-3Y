ASSIGNMENT 1

Q1. Explain the difference between frontend, backend, and full-stack development with suitable real-world examples.
ans:- 
1. Frontend Development:- Frontend is the part of a website or app that users see and use. It includes buttons, images, menus, and web pages.

Example: On Amazon, the product page, search bar, and "Add to Cart" button are part of the frontend.

2. Backend Development:- Backend is the part that works behind the scenes. It stores data, processes requests, and connects to the database.

Example: When you place an order on Amazon, the backend checks payment, updates stock, and saves your order.

3. Full-Stack Development:- A full-stack developer works on both frontend and backend.

Example: A full-stack developer can create the shopping page, connect it to the database, and make the order system work.

     3. Returns Data
              |
        Web Server (Server)
              |
     4. Sends Response
   (Web Page / Data / Images)
              |
          Client (User)
     (Displays the Web Page)



Q3. Describe how a browser requests and displays a web page from a web server.
ans:- 
1. The user enters a website address (URL) in the browser.
2. The browser sends a request to the web server.
3. The web server receives the request and processes it.
4. If needed, the server retrieves data from the database.
5. The server sends the requested web page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) back to the browser.
6. The browser reads the files and displays the web page on the user's screen.



Q4. Identify and list the tools required to set up a web development environment. Explain the purpose of each.
ans:- 
1. Code Editor (VS Code)
Purpose: Used to write and edit HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming code.

2. Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
Purpose: Used to view and test web pages.

3. Web Browser Developer Tools
Purpose: Used to inspect HTML/CSS, debug JavaScript, and test websites.

4. Local Server (XAMPP, WAMP, or Live Server)
Purpose: Runs websites on your computer for testing before publishing them online.

5. Version Control (Git)
Purpose: Tracks code changes and helps manage different versions of a project.

6. GitHub
Purpose: Stores code online, allows collaboration, and provides backup.



Q5. Explain what a web server is and give examples of commonly used servers.
ans:-
A web server is software or a computer that stores website files and delivers them to users' browsers when they request a web page over the internet.
